# Containerization

Containerization is a lightweight form of virtualization that involves encapsulating an application and its dependencies into a container. This approach ensures that the application runs consistently across different computing environments, whether it's on a developer's local machine, in a test environment, or in production. Containers are isolated from each other and include everything needed to run the application, such as libraries, dependencies, and configuration files.
