# Ansible Architecture

### Ansible Architecture
Ansible operates on a client-server architecture, but it is agentless. This means no software or daemons are required to be installed on managed nodes (client machines) for Ansible to function. Instead, Ansible connects to nodes over SSH (Linux/Unix) or WinRM (Windows) to execute tasks remotely.

- Ansible automates Configuration Management, deployment, and Orchestration (computing) and Provisioning.
- Uses playbooks (written in YAML) to define workflows.
- Supports modules, APIs, and plugins to extend functionality.
