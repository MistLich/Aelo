# Docker Compose

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to configure the application's services and then uses those configurations to spin up all the containers needed for the application to run. Docker Compose simplifies the process of managing multi-container Docker applications by allowing you to define them as code, making them easier to replicate and share.
