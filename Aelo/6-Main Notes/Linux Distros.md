# Linux Distros

Linux distributions (often shortened to "distros") are variations of the Linux operating system that are built from the same basic components (the Linux kernel and GNU utilities), but packaged with different software bundles, desktop environments, and system configurations to meet specific needs or preferences of users.

rpm - more security and tested software .rpm
Debian - focus more on user friendly .deb
