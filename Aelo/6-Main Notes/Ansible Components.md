# Ansible Components

1. **Control Node**: The machine where Ansible is installed and from which all tasks and playbooks are executed. It manages the configuration of managed nodes.
    
2. **Inventory**: A file or directory that contains a list of managed nodes. It defines which hosts Ansible can connect to and manage. Inventory can be static or dynamic (e.g., generated by a script).
    
3. **Playbooks**: Written in YAML format, playbooks are Ansible’s configuration, deployment, and orchestration language. They describe a set of tasks to be performed on remote nodes. Ansible Playbooks can include roles, which are reusable units of tasks and configuration.
    
4. **Modules**: Ansible modules are discrete units of code that perform specific tasks on managed nodes. They are executed by the control node and are designed to be idempotent (i.e., the result of applying a module multiple times should be the same as applying it once).
    
5. **Tasks**: Tasks are actions performed by modules in playbooks. Each task maps to a module and defines what action needs to be executed on the managed nodes.
    
6. **Handlers**: Handlers are special tasks triggered by another task’s result. They are used to restart services, reload configurations, or perform other actions that need to be handled only once at the end of a playbook run.
