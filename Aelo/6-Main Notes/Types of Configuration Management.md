# Types of Configuration Management

Push and Pull approach

Push - Central server is pushing configurations on the nodes
Pull - Nodes dynamically update themselves with the configuration present in the server periodically

Chef and Puppet pull based - pulls config from a central server
Ansible and SaltStack push based configuration management tools - directly push to node machines
