# Continuous Monitoring

Continuous monitoring is the process of constantly observing and analyzing IT systems, applications, and network infrastructure to ensure they meet performance, security, and compliance requirements. This approach allows organizations to detect and respond to issues in real-time, maintaining system integrity and minimizing downtime. 

NAGIOS is a tool used for CM.

Continuous monitoring why ?
- Failure of CI/CD pipeline
- Rapid introduction of performance problems and errors of new endpoints causing monitoring issues
- Lengthy root cause analysis as the number of services expands
- Server health cannot be compromised at any cost
- CM tools resolve any sort of system errors before the have any impact on business/application

Tools - Nagios, Amazon CloudWatch
